# Pop-up_cafe
This programme was designed for an experimental pop up cafe.
Docker was used to run and load the data to MySql database
The environment variables needed to connect to the databaase were loaded from a .env file (not included).
The programme is later rewritten and converted to a full functional website using Django.
The website accepts paypal, Stripe among other forms of payment.
It is now a fully functional website but in continous development.
You can visit an earlier version of the website at https://just-orderit.herokuapp.com/ (media files not served because they're removed from AWS S3 for now).
