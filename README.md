# Pop-up_cafe
This programme was designed for an experimental pop up cafe.
Docker was used to manage the development stage.
The environment variables needed to connect to the databaase were loaded from a .env file (not included).
The programme is later rewritten and converted to a full functional website using Django.
The website accepts paypal payment.
It is now a fully functional website but in continous development.
You can visit an earlier version of the website at https://just-orderit.herokuapp.com/.
